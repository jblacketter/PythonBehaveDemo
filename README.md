# Introduction:
This is an example of using python behave as a framework. This example is a work in progress based on practioner and web portals which are temporarily turned off. I plan to continue development when those services are restored

# History: 
The initial version of this project was based on NodeJS with typescript using Cucumber. There were some issues with maintaining this framework over time so I decided to convert it over to Python as an example to learn the language. It was relatively easy to drag and drop the original Cucumber feature files and rebuild using Python Behave. The same page object design applied.

# Gherkin
The advantage gherkin format was to make the test cases more readable to a wider audience.

Instructions for using selenium grid (link to selenium grid project using Docker-compose)
